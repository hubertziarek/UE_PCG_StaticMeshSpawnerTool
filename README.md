# UE_PCG_StaticMeshSpawnerTool
Tool for Unreal Engine 5.3 created to support creating PCG graphs.
It allows you to select meshes in the World Editor Window, then add them to the list, set the required weights, and add them at once to the Static Mesh Spawner node. The node might be chosen from the existing ones or created a completely new one.
NOTE: It works only with the PCGMeshSelectorWeighted type of the Static Mesh Spawner.
